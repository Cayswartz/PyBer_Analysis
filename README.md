# PyBer_Analysis
# Ride-Sharing Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
In this assignment, we are conducting analysis for Pyber, a python based ride-sharing app. We are performing analysis on the number of drives, total fares, cities, number of riders and more! Ultimately, the analysis will help Pyber ensure affordability for under served neighborhoods. 


## Results
Overall, the most ride and traffic on the app are seen in Urban cities as well as the largest aount of spend at 1,625 and $39,854. On top of receving the most traffic, Urban areas also see the lowest average fare per driver and average fare per rider at $16.57 and $24.53, respectively. When looking at the lowest traffic area, rural areas, we are seeing omly 125 rides with a total of 75 drivers however the average fare per ride sits at $34.52 and the average fare per drive is $55.49. Suburban areas sit in the middle with 625 rides total and 490 drivers. Suburban areas see a average fare per ride of $30.97 and an average fare per driver of $39.50. Overall, we saw a total fares for rural areas at $4,327.93, suburban areas at $19,356 and urban at $39,854. The total drivers also vary from city type to city type with urban having the most at 2405, then surbuban as 490 and lastly rural at 78.

## Summary
There is a clear discrepency in the ride-share experience that each city type has. 

One of the largest issues is how expensive it is to ride in a rural area. I would suggest providing incentive for drivers in that area to increase the number of drivers which would then make a driver more accessible and hopefully drive down the prices per ride in that area. 

Urban drivers are also being paid much less than rural or suburban drivers due to the fact that there are more drivers than rides taken. I would suggest being more selective when hiring driver in urban areas in order to ensure that the drivers you do have are able to have enough work. 

Lastly, I would use suburban areas as your benchmark as they seem to be the most balanced in both the average fare for riders and average fare for drivers. Take a look at the total rides to total drivers ratio and attempt to achieve this in all city types.
