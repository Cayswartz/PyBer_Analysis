# Ride-Sharing Analysis with Matplotlib

## Overview of Analysis
In this assignment, we are conducting analysis for Pyber, a python based ride-sharing app. We are performing analysis on the number of drives, total fares, cities, number of riders and more! Ultimately, the analysis will help Pyber ensure affordability for under served neighborhoods.
